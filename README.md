# Feel Fit — Emotion & Goal-Aware Fitness Coach

A React Native (Expo) app that proposes the best workout for your time window and focus (Mental / Physical / Both), grounded in MET intensity and enhanced by AI coaching. It builds mental & physical stamina with science-backed guidance while staying lightweight for everyday users.

## Features

### 🧠 Mental Wellness
- Emotion-based workout matching (mindfulness, breathing, soothing mobility)  
- Mental stamina accrues from low-impact focus work  
- Healing audio guidance with calming neural voice and optional background tracks  

### 💪 Physical Fitness
- Goal-oriented plans (metabolism, weight loss, toning, stamina, fitness, immune)  
- MET-grounded intensity with progression when appropriate  
- Motivational coaching with energetic neural voice  

### ⚖️ Balanced Sessions
- Combine mental & physical benefits in one plan  
- Dual stamina gains; adaptive audio for each block  
- Clear “Why this?” line referencing monotony/strain or recovery intent  

### 📊 Progress & Insight
- Totals, minutes, completion, streaks  
- Training Monotony (7d) & Strain (7d) indicators (MET-based) to prevent overload  
- Daily Coach Note history (14 days)  

### 🗣️ Audio & Interaction
- Neural TTS (ElevenLabs) with cache; device TTS fallback  
- Healing Music Picker (multi-select loops) with auto-ducking during voice  
- BPM Step Sync: background tracks adapt to intensity tiers (90/110/130/150 BPM)  
- Push-to-Talk micro-commands: Pause, Resume, Skip, Time remaining, Slower, Faster

- **Auth:** Supabase Auth (email/password)  
- **AI Text:** OpenAI (suggestions & summaries) with strict caching  
- **Audio:** Expo AV, ElevenLabs TTS (+ device fallback)  
- **Animations:** React Native Reanimated  
- **Icons:** lucide-react-native  
- **Styling:** React Native StyleSheet

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+  
- npm or yarn  
- Expo CLI  
- Supabase project (URL + anon key)  
- OpenAI & ElevenLabs API keys  

### Installation
1. **Install dependencies**  
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Set environment variables**  
   Create `.env` with:
   ```ini
   EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
   EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key
   ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=your_elevenlabs_key
   ```

3. **Start development**  
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

### Notes
- AI text is cached & rate-limited (1 suggestion/day, 1 summary/day)  
- Offline or missing keys → fallback to rule-based text and device TTS  

---

## Database Setup
Tables created automatically:
- **users** — Profile & stamina  
- **workout_sessions** — Session history (duration, MET, completion)  
- **mood_logs** — Post-session mood  
- **daily_summaries** — One/day, cached text + metrics  

All with Row Level Security (RLS).

## App Architecture

### Navigation
```
app/
├─ _layout.tsx
└─ (tabs)/
   ├─ _layout.tsx
   ├─ index.tsx       # Home (plan & suggestion)
   ├─ progress.tsx    # Charts, streaks, monotony/strain
   ├─ stamina.tsx     # Mental/Physical levels & badges
   └─ profile.tsx     # Settings & consent
```

### Components (excerpt)
```
components/
├─ SuggestionCard.tsx      # Plan + “Why this?”
├─ EditPlanSheet.tsx       # Adjust plan
├─ TwoChoicePrompt.tsx     # Quick adjust (harder/easier)
├─ HealingMusicPicker.tsx  # Background music
├─ PTTButton.tsx           # Push-to-Talk
└─ WorkoutTimer.tsx        # Timer + audio engine
```

## Data Flow
1. User selects focus (Mental / Physical / Both) + time window  
2. Engine ranks exercises (MET × Monotony/Strain × Variety/Progression)  
3. AI rewrites plan into coaching text (cached)  
4. Workout runs with voice + music (ducked, BPM-synced)  
5. Session saved → stamina & metrics updated  
6. Daily Coach Note generated at night or next open

## Workout Matching & Science
- **MET-based intensity:** per exercise block  
- **Training Monotony (7d):** load mean ÷ std (MET-minutes)  
- **Training Strain (7d):** monotony × total load  
- **Variety:** penalizes repeats when monotony high  
- **Progression:** allows overload when metrics support it  
- **Two-Choice Quick Adjust:** only on uncertain days → Go harder or Keep light  
- **Why this?** always references real metrics (monotony, recovery, or goal fit)  

---

## Stamina System
- **Mental stamina:** mindfulness, breathing, mobility  
- **Physical stamina:** cardio, strength, endurance (heavier weight on intensity)  
- **Levels:** Starter → Beginner → Beginner+ → Intermediate → Advanced → Elite  

---

## Audio Coaching
- **Healing (Mental):** calming neural voice, background loops, auto-duck  
- **Motivational (Physical):** energetic neural voice, BPM sync  
- **Micro-commands:** Push-to-Talk for Pause/Resume/Skip/Time/Slower/Faster  

---

## Settings & Privacy
- Toggles (default ON): AI Text, Neural Voice, BPM Sync, Two-Choice Card  
- Voice picker, music multi-select, disliked/equipment prefs  
- **Privacy:** only anonymized aggregates sent to AI  
- **Budget:** caching + rate limits ensure <$3/mo typical use  

---

## Development

```bash
npm run dev       # start dev server
npm run test      # run unit tests
npm run build:web # web build
```
